# youtube-clone
I successfully completed a YouTube clone project, where I designed and developed a video-sharing platform with features similar to YouTube. The project allowed users to upload, share, and view videos, with functionality for commenting, liking, and subscribing to channels. I implemented user authentication, video playback, and search functionality, among other features, to create a seamless userÂ experience.
